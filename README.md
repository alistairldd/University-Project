This project was made in pair.

In this project, we were reproducing the board game L'ile Maudite.

Made in Java.

projetHuffman : 

This project was made in pair.

In this project, we were aiming to reproduce Huffman's algorithm, in order to compress files.

This was made in OCaml.

----

projetKetchappCircle : 

This project was made alone for the course concurrent programming. 

It was the first step toward a bigger project so that we learn how to better use threads. 

A complete report will be available once the project is done.


----

projetCompilor : 

This project was made for the course Compilor. 

In this project we made a parser and a lexer, and also a compilor that translates to MIPS language in order to execute Go code. 

You can find the report (in French) in the folder.

Made in OCaml.

projetMummy :

This project was made with my pair Wang Marc.

In this project, we have realised a 3D game in which we can move in a 3D scene and our goal is to explore a labyrinth, with at least one mummy inside. Good Luck !

Made in pseudo java on the app processing.

projetFourmi : 

Ant project carried out as part of the course Modular Programming.
We simulate colonies of ants fighting each other and observe the result by creating a GIF. To try it by yourself, you should do :

make all && ./main && convert -delay 10 -loop 0 *.ppm -scale 500% animation.gif

If you don't have the library required to convert, try (on linux) :

sudo apt update && sudo apt install imagemagick
